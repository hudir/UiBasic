The tab order should follow the flow of the page: left to right, top to bottom - header, main navigation, content buttons and inputs,
and finally the footer.

Top and bottom margins of elements are collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.
This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!


NOTE : If one of the properties in the shorthand declaration is the bg-size property, you must use a / (slash) to separate it from the
bg-position property, e.g. background: url(smiley.gif) 10px 20px/50px 50px; will result in a background image, positioned 10 pixels
from the left, 20 pixels from the top, and the size of the image will be 50 pixels wide and 50 pixels hight.
